package config

/**
 * Package config is a simple package to provide an easy to use interface to the TOML configuration files
 * utilized by the RSCGo game.  It does little more than define the TOML configuration data structure,
 * and provide an API to easily and consistently access this data structure across the entire code base.
 *
 * This package may eventually be expanded to support some form of SQL persistence, rather than TOML, or
 * as an alternative, or maybe even in addition to the TOML configuration.  This is all just thoughts right now,
 * for the time being I have no active plans to modify the way that this package functions.
