package rand

/**
 * Package rand implements some utility functions that make using the random APIs in the Go standard library
 * easier.  Truthfully, this package is likely getting removed in an upcoming revision.  It can probably be merged
 * with the isaac package.

 * TODO: Merge with ISAAC package.
